# hugo-sideloader
A bash script for combining a single page html/css/js project with Hugo static site generator

Steps:
- put script in folder where files are to be added
- give executable privileges
- run with ./load.sh \<path-to-blog-file\> (include path to base hugo dir)
- script will ask user for project name


What It Does:
- gets \<blog-path\>
- gets project title
- copies .html main page from project, puts into blog-path/content/projects
- adds front matter to top of .html file
- checks if blog-path/layouts/demo/demo.html exists, if not, makes demo/demo.html
- copies everything else (exceptions: load.sh script, README.md, .git folder) into blog-path/static/demos/project-title

What It Doesn't Do (Yet):
- replaces link paths in .html with new correct paths relative to hugo folder structure
